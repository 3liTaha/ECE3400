      <h1  class="display-4">Lab 1</h1>
      <p class="lead">In this initial lab we set up the main actuators of the robot, the servos, as well as the ultrasonic sensors which are essential to its functionality and its ability to solve the maze. In the sections below we elaborate on the steps we took to assemble the robot frame and configure the servos and the ultrasonic sensors. We describe why servos, rather than other actuators, were used and what challenges were faced in the process of configuring them. Afterwards we go over the ultrasonic sensors, how they work, and how our code. Finally we show our robot routinely navigating a very basic maze described by the course staff! </p>
      <h1  class="display-5">Assembling the Frame</h1>
      <p class="lead">The robot came with a red aluminum frame that has mounts for two servos as well as a front wheel. Due to availability, a caster wheel was used as the front wheel. Two FS90r servos capable of full rotation were mounted on the frame. The process was challenging because of the size of the screws. After mounting the servos and the front wheel, back wheels were attached to servos. By this point the chassis of the robot was complete. Afterward, batteries were mounted to the top of the robot using Velcro. A battery pack of AA batteries was used in conjunction with a 9V battery. The 9V battery is intended to power the Arduino, while the AA battery pack is intended to power the servos on the device. Afterwards, the final step was attaching a breadboard on top of the two batteries, which is where all of the of the electronics are assembled. The assembly of the electronics is described in the next section.</p>
      <h1  class="display-5">Assembling the Electronics</h1>
      <p class="lead">The electronic component of this robot consisted of an Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and servos. These were connected using a read board and wires. Throughout the process the pinout for the Arduino board was used to determine which pins are used. The servos were connected to pins that were designed to send out PWM signals, which are necessary for controlling their speed. The Ultrasonic sensors had two important signal lines: the trigger line and the echo line. Triggers of the sensors were connected together and also hooked up to one of the PWM pins. The rest of the echo signals were connected to digital pins on the Arduino. After setting up the connections , power lines were established on the rails of the breadboard from the batteries and we then proceeded to programming.</p>
