      <h1  class="display-4">Lab 2</h1>
      <p class="lead">In the previous labs we built the robot base, its actuators, and gave it ultrasonic sensor to guide its sensor. In this lab we add phototransistors to enable us to detect light being emitted in the environment of the robot. These phototransistors will guide the robot in its final mission to find and identify targets in a maze at the end of the class. In particular, these phototransistors will be used in conjunction with the analog to digital convertor on board of the Arduino Nano in order to detect when the robot is very close to a treasure that is marked emitting a particular frequency. In this lab we set up the mechanism for using the phototransistors to detect what frequency is being emitted near the robot.
In addition, we start establishing the base station for the robot which consist of the an Arduino n a bread board saw  well as a seven segment led display that will be used in order to display the frequency the robot is measuring with its sensors. the set up of the seven segment led and the base station was done as instructed in the lab. In the labs that follow this one we add Bluetooth modules for communication between the robot and the base station started here. </p>

      <p class="lead">In this first part of the lab we work on setting up IR detection on the robot and configure the code for figuring out the frequency of the IR detection.
<br>
The detection circuit we build consists of two components: photoresistors and resistors. the circuit is shown in the diagram below. Note that the circuit is set up with a pull down resistor in order to avoid floating values that may make it hard or impossible to read the analog circuit properly. After this circuit was setup on a breadboard, the integrity and behavior of the circuit were verified. This was done by building a second circuit that consisted of an IR LED that was powered with a signal generator. The signal generator was configured to send sinusoidal signals to the LED at 1kHZ. That set up emulated the signals that we expected to find in our maze during the final lab. We used this set up then to send signals to our phototransistor and used an oscilloscope in order to measure the signal detected by the phototransistor to verify that it behaved as expected. It did, and a snap shot of the signal observed in the oscilloscope is shown below. 
<br>
After verifying the correctness of our circuit we attached the circuit analog pin to our Arduino and used the code provided in class to measure the frequency of the signal and print it to the serial monitor. The code uses an internal reference voltage of 1.5V to determine the value of our signal relevant to ground and then uses the count of times the signal crosses the reference voltage in a period of time to find the frequency of the analog signal. We measured a frequency of 1 kHz with our circuit, and recorded the output of our serial monitor. A screenshot of that output is shown below. By verifying our circuit using an oscilloscope first, we were able to debug the code and the Arduino set up faster. One of the challenges that faced us was that the photoresistor wasn't sensitive enough to the signal, this was a consequence of the reference voltage being too high after. After adjusting that, we were ready to detect any treasures in the final maze that we will have to solve in the end of the lass and moved on to the next part!</p>
